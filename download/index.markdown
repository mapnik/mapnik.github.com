### Anonymous SVN access

All mapnik's source files are maintained in a Git  repository.
You will need a Git client installed on your machine.
You can use the command-line client or GUI - it's up to you.

Please, consult [Git documentation](http://git-scm.com/documentation) on client availibility for your platform, usage etc.

Using command-line client you can clone the latest source like this:


Latest release (2.0.0) : <a href="http://prdownload.berlios.de/mapnik/mapnik-2.0.0.tar.bz2">Download (tar.bz2)</a>

Access to the current Mapnik development code:

    git clone git@github.com:mapnik/mapnik.git

You can also browse source files through [web-based Git repository access] (http://trac.mapnik.org/browser/)

Once you have downloaded the Mapnik source code see the [Mapnik Install](https://github.com/mapnik/mapnik/wiki) guides or the [INSTALL](https://github.com/mapnik/mapnik/blob/master/INSTALL.md) document in the Git repository.
