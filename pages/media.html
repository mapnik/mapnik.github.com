<p>When youâ€™re using the Mapnik logo with other graphic elements, make sure you give our logo some room. The minimum size of the logo should be 28 pixels with 3px of letter-spacing, and the empty space around the logo should be at least 150% the size of the logo itself.</p>

<p><h2>Mapnik typeface and logo mark</h2></p>

Mapnik's new modern typeface and logo mark is powerful, modern, and flexible. Much like Mapnik itself. We primarily use the Maven Pro font family with Open Sans Light for it's simple elegance.
