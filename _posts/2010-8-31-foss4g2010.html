<img src="/images/foss4g2010.png" /><p>I'm going to be at FOSS4G 2010 next week in Barcelona. The last time I was in Spain was the final day of <a href="http://stateofthemap.org/">SOTM</a> and the day Spain won the world cup. I'm excited to return!</p><img src="/images/barcelona.png" /><p>On tap will be a great workshop run by Iván Sánchez Ortega on using Mapnik to render OSM data: <a href="http://2010.foss4g.org/workshop03.php">W-03:  Setting up an OpenStreetMap rendering toolchain</a></p><p>Mapnik is also participating in the FOSS4G <a href="http://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/Benchmarking_2010">WMS Shootout</a> this year, a friendly competition of many of the leading open source and non-open source servers out there. Before this month Mapnik didn't really a fast C-based WMS server, but <a href="http://github.com/springmeyer/paleoserver">I wrote one</a>, and <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Mod_mapnik_wms">so did Frederik</a>. I'll be reporting soon on some of the speed improvements and other lessons learned during this excellent and fun exercise. Huge thanks to <a href="http://www.mkgeomatics.com/">Matt Kenny</a> for designing the styles for the shootout which were required to match all other servers.</p><p>Hope to see you at FOSS4G!</p>
