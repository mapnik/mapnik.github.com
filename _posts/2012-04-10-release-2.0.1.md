The Mapnik team is pleased to announce Mapnik 2.0.1, the first stable bugfix release on top of 2.0.0. The notable thing about this release is that it fully supports PostGIS 2.0.

For details on other fixes (all back-ported from current master, which is the 2.1.x series), see the 2.1.0 entry in the [master CHANGELOG](https://github.com/mapnik/mapnik/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).
