title: "Code Sprint prep - ready your compiles"
author: Dane Springmeyer

<p>In the upcoming <a href="http://trac.mapnik.org/wiki/MapnikCodeSprint">sprint</a> success will largely be felt in the richness of conversations and smart brainstorming - as it is the first time many Mapnik developers have met each other (or at least the ones at -8 UTC like me).</p><img src="http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/compiling.png" /><p>But, we're certainly planning on getting some code written, and the less time we spend sword fighting (perhaps =) ) the better. So, if you are attending the sprint, or participating from afar, make sure you are running <a href="http://trac.mapnik.org/wiki/Mapnik2">Mapnik2</a> and make sure you've taken the time to make sure your compiles are <a href="http://trac.mapnik.org/wiki/FasterCompiling">as fast as possible.</a></p>
