The Mapnik team is pleased to announce the Mapnik 2.2.0 release. This time around we've been focusing primarily on stability and performance, but there are some new cool features too. It's fun this release coincides with this weekend's [SOTMUS](http://stateofthemap.us/) in San Francisco and we hope to see you there!
