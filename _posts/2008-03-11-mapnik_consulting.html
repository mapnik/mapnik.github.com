I have been consulting for a few years now, but I think the time has come to move things up a gear. Have a look, it even has 'rounded' corners:).</p><p>While Mapnik itself plays a central role, my consultancy goes beyond just rendering maps. We offer a wide range of geospatial services. </p><p>This in no way means that Mapnik will be overlooked, if anything I'm hoping to increase the pace of development!</p><p>Cheers!</p>
