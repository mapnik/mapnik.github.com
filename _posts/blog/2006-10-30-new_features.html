<p>Well overdue, but here is some exciting news. Aaron Mitti and Vincent Spader have joined the Mapnik development team and done a brilliant job improving text rendering. As a result we now have 'follow line' text placement and 'ShieldSymbolizer - combined label/text - very useful for things like motorways. A big thank-you to Aaron and Vince!</p><p>I've created a couple of 'Google Maps' demos to demonstrate these and other new features:<ul><li><a href="http://mapnik.org/tiling/vancouver/">Vancouver, BC</a></li><li><a href="http://mapnik.org/tiling/oxford/">Oxford, UK</a> (where I live)</li></ul>The first uses datasets from <a href="http://www.geogratis.gc.ca/">GeoGratis (Canada)</a> and the second is based on the entirely free <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org">OpenStreetMap</a>. Great project! I might get myself a GPS and join in.</p><p>Tiles for both demos are rendered with simple <a href="http://www.python.org">Python</a> script using Mapnik's bindings and added as a custom layer to the by now familiar GMap2 interface.</p><p>Recently I've been able to focus again on Mapnik, and there should more news very soon. Stay tuned!</p>
