<p>      The Mapnik team is pleased to announce that Mapnik 2.0 is finally here! We've jumped from 0.7 to 2.0, not because we got confused with our numbers, but to reflect that this release represents a big step forward for the project. We believe Mapnik 2.0 will provide a much more flexible and expressive platform for creating beautiful maps. For full details see:       <ul><li>  <a href="http://trac.mapnik.org/milestone/Mapnik%202.0">Milestone Mapnik 2.0</a></li><li>  <a href="http://trac.mapnik.org/wiki/Release2.0.0">CHANGELOG for 2.0.0</a></li>      </ul>    </p>    <p>      Thanks to all contributors and also a supersize thank-you as always to <a href="http://dbsgeo.com">Dane Springmeyer</a> for managing and inspiring this release.      This is a recommended upgrade for all Mapnik users.    </p>    <p>      <i>NOTE: This release is going out without Windows binaries just yet, as a source distribution only. We're planning to follow up with Windows and Mac OS X binaries asap.</i>    </p>
