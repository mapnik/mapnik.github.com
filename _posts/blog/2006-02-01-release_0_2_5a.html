<p>I'm very pleased to announce mapnik's new release. We've been working hard to get here. The main focus of this release is to provide a better user experience while installing mapnik, which hopefully will bring more people on board. I know, there is room for further improvements but this is a step in the right direction. This release offers:<ol><li>new build system</li><li>new <a href="/documentation/install/">INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS</a></li><li>new symbolizers (polygon/line patterns)</li><li>lots of fixes.</li></ol><p><p>Big thanks go to Jean-François Doyon, who in his spare time, refactored mapnik's source tree and wrote a better build system using SCons.<br />Enjoy!</p>
