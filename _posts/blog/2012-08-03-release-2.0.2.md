The Mapnik team is pleased to announce Mapnik 2.0.2, the second stable bugfix release in the 2.0.x series, and also the last as development is now focused exclusively on the upcoming 2.1.x series (the one that supports compositing).

For details on 2.0.2 fixes see the [Changelog](https://github.com/mapnik/mapnik/wiki/Release2.0.2).

Get the source from the [downloads page](http://mapnik.org/download/).

Note for TileMill users: TileMill currently requires Mapnik >= 2.1.x and will not work with 2.0.2. So, if you are looking for a release for TileMill stay tuned and watch for 2.1 to be released [very soon](https://github.com/mapnik/mapnik/issues?milestone=8&state=open).
