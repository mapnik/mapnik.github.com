Second Mapnik Code Sprint is fast approaching! We're gathering in DC on 16-17 June.
Read more details on [Wiki](https://github.com/mapnik/mapnik/wiki/Code-sprint).
We will have on the spot and remote participation, so you can join from the comfort of your own
sofa/desk/... 

If you haven't done so, yet, do read [Richard Weait's excellent post to Mapnik-group](https://groups.google.com/d/topic/mapnik/thR70nJ0TWA/discussion) on why you should be there. 

Join us and help to shape the future of Open Source cartography!
