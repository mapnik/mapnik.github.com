<p>Yesterday, I built and packaged <a href="http://media.mapnik.org/mapnik_win32-bin_20070426.zip">win32 binaries for Mapnik</a>. All libraries including dependencies are built with VC++ Express on Vista.</p><P>There is no installer (yet) so you have to setup %PATH% etc yourself. In 'bin' directory (e.g c:\\\\mapnik\\\\bin ) there is a small demo application 'rundemo.exe' which produces two map images from demo data. You can run it like this:<pre>rundemo.exe c:\\mapnik\\lib\\mapnik\\input </pre></p><p>Everyone (with Windows box) is encouraged to give it a try and report any problems, gotchas ...  If everything is OK then win32 binaries will be available as a part of Mapnik release, starting from 0.4.1. <br/><br/>Cheers,<br/>Artem</p>
