Join me in <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/index.html?lat=53.46238251844256&lon=-2.2327283539696614&zoom=15">Manchester, UK</a> on 14-15 of July for the <a href="http://www.stateofthemap.org">State of the Map</a>. I'll be talking about Mapnik, Openstreetmap and more. It is promising to be the conference of the year and if you're not signed yet, hurry up!</p><p> Other news: there is a new site <a href="http://new.kosmosnimki.ru"> Kosmosnimki </a> which has a slick JavaScript interface, a full map of Russia (rendered with Mapnik) and there are high resolution photographs of the Moscow region. They're planning to have full satellite coverage in the future. Looks really cool, check it out!</p>
