We are on the final hurdles for a 3.0.0 release! We have officially released and tagged a 3.0.0-rc2 build and are in a feature freeze. We expect the current C++ API not to change and could really use help testing our release candidate.

You can [download](https://github.com/mapnik/mapnik/archive/v3.0.0-rc2.tar.gz) the release canidate or checkout out the tag from our [github repository](https://github.com/mapnik/mapnik/tree/v3.0.0-rc2). 

You are welcome to follow all our conversations up to this release on [github](https://github.com/mapnik/mapnik/issues/2811).
