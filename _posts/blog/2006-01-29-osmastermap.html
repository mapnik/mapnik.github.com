<p>I just stumbled on <a href="http://www.edparsons.com">Ed Parson's</a> blog entry <a href="http://www.edparsons.com/?p=132">&quot;When is a map not a map.. when it's Mastermap&quot;</a>, and I cannot agree more with both responders: <a href="http://think.random-stuff.org/">Alan Doyle</a> and <a href="http://www.mysociety.org/">Tom Steinberg</a>. Why would one want to hack a teeny-weeny piece of <a href="http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/oswebsite/products/osmastermap/topography/sample.html"> Basingstoke or Port Talbot</a>? Anyway, I figured out that I can use it to show off some of mapnik's styling capabilities. I downloaded the sample and followed OSMM _House style_(not quite, I got a bit lazy to specify all styles needed) and here it is:</p><p><a href="/maps/#osmm"><img src="/images/osmastermap_tiny.png" alt="os mastermap" /></a></p>
