Mapnik has a new look. Not just a fresh coat, goals for Mapnik's redesign include:
 1) Better documentation for Mapnik code, bindings, and styling.
 2) More accessible news / updates regarding Mapnik.
 3) Get started with Mapnik faster.


## Mapnik faster

Quickly copy code snippets to run and render mapnik with Node.js, Python, or C++ code bindings and pair with a simple XML stylesheet. And link directly to off-site API docs for futher reference.

[Latest news post]({{site.baseurl}}#latest-news}}) or [entire news archive]({{site.baseurl}}/news/archive.html) now only a click away.


## Logo

Inspired by the previous logo, the "mapnik" mark is now typeset in [open-source](http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&id=OFL) Google Font [Maven Pro](https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Maven+Pro), selected particularly for it's double story a, dramatic k, and the square [tittle](http://blog.dictionary.com/tittle/) over the i. Maven Pro is a modern san-serif font with unique curves and a nice, pronounced rhythm.



## Colors

Taking note from previous colors, we've pick a more vibrant, yet earthy palatte. Featuring a lighter sky blue that balances well with earth-tones and the warmth of traditional topographic map of natural and man-made features.
