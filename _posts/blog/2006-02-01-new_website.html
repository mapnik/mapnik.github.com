<p>Well, here it is. Finally we've got the new site running! It is hosted by <a href="http://www.zettai.net/">Zettai</a> and it is <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a>. </p><p>While <a href="http://berlios.de">BerliOS</a> provides an excellent service, I always had reservations about the Mambo/PHP based site. There are a couple of reasons for that:<ul>  <li>one of mapnik's goals is to provide bindings for 'cool' high-level languages and Python fits this bill nicely</li>  <li>let's spit it out: PHP sucks! (IMHO).</li></ul></p><p>I hope you'll enjoy the new site and feel free to send your comments/suggestions.</p>
