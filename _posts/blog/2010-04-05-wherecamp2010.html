<p>Great session on Mapnik at <a href='http://web.archive.org/web/20100426170615/http://www.wherecampsocal.org/'>WhereCamp 2010</a> hosted by Google in Mountain View, California.</p><p>A group of Mapnik users met for a hour to discuss and brainstorm around potential future features of Mapnik.  These include both external tools that we should collaborate on designing (that don't belong in Mapnik Core) and potential advancements that could be added to Mapnik core to make life making beautiful maps better.</p>
