<p>Over the last year of my involvement with Mapnik I've seen a huge growth in Mapnik users running on Macs.  While most ultimately deploy their mapping systems on Linux, for many it all starts on the Mac.</p><h2>Macs for Mapping?</h2>

<p>OS X, with XCode installed, is a great platform for getting up and running with Mapnik as Apple provides many of the solid *nix libraries you need to get started compiling. Apple also pre-installs a multi-architecture build of the latest Python release, which makes getting started with Python easy.</p>

<p>But this same batteries-includes philosophy can trip up from-source installations due to the potential for duplicate libraries and python versions, especially when users are employing open source packaging system like Macports.</p><p>Additionally... </p><p>What if you're at a conference and don't want to download the several GB's needed for the iPhone/XCode development environment just get a vanilla Mac rendering a few OpenStreetMap tiles?</p><p>What if you are deploying Mac mini's in the field and need a fast, lightweight, offline deployment setup?</p><p>Or what if you just need to get your designers up and running with<a href="http://bitbucket.org/springmeyer/quantumnik/"> Quantumnik</a> and <a href="http://www.qgis.org/">QGIS</a> and don't want them to have to hassle with Python versions?</p><h2>It could be easier</h2><p>For all these reasons, and more, it should be easier, and it can be.</p>

<p>Now you can just head over to <a href="http://dbsgeo.com/downloads/">dbsgeo.com</a> and grab the latest release or latest trunk build and you can have Mapnik running in literally minutes.</p><p>Thanks to the support from <a href="http://developmentseed.org/">Development Seed</a>, the great wisdom and advice of <a href="http://www.kyngchaos.com/">William Kyngesburye<a/>, and many months of testing from <a href="http://inaturalist.org/">a long</a> <a href="http://koordinates.com/">list</a> <a href="http://spatialguru.com/epifanio">of</a> <a href="http://www.geosmart.co.nz/">intrepid</a> Mapnik users, these installers should be pretty solid. If you find problems or have suggestions to improve them (there are certainly lots of potential ways!) please post your reports to <a href="http://trac.mapnik.org">the Mapnik Trac site</a>.</p>
