<a href="http://www.soc.org.uk/">The 43rd Annual Summer School of the Society of Cartographers</a> has started in <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/?lat=50.79624752277573&lon=-1.0971296609368695&zoom=15">Portsmouth, UK</a>. I'll be there on 5-6 September, talking about Mapnik on 6th. Join in if you're around.</p>

<p>Also, now that my old computer has died I purchased a Mac Mini and I'm hoping to resume win32 stuff soon.</p>

<p>Cheers</p>
