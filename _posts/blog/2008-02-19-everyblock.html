<p>For those of you who don't follow <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com">Django</a> - there is a great new project out there - <a href="http://www.everyblock.com">EveryBlock</a>. Adrian Holovaty and the team have been busy putting local information on the web, giving people chance to check everything from restaurants violating the NY trans fats ban to lost property. It is very nicely put together and it's Django of course. </p><p>There is an <a href="http://www.fimoculous.com/archive/post-3860.cfm">interview with Adrian</a> where he talks, amongst other things, about the technology behind the scenes, which includes Mapnik. Also, the developer in charge of maps <a href="http://blog.everyblock.com/2008/feb/18/maps/">Paul Smith describes the reasoning</a> behind their decision not to go with the usual suspects -  Google, Yahoo!, or Microsoft.</p><p>It is really great to see Mapnik being used to create highly customized, beautiful cartography!</p><img src="/images/everyblock.png" />
