## Overview

This tutorial will ensure that Mapnik and Node.

## Step 1: check installation 

Make sure you have mapnik installed. You should be able to open a terminal and type:

    mapnik-config -v # should return a version number.

This tutorial expects Mapnik 2.x or greater. Older versions do not provide the `mapnik-config` program, so we recommend upgrading.


Please note that if you are using mapnik 2.0.0 then you will need to adjust the "mapnik" module name to "mapnik2" in the Python commands. Refer to [[mapnik2]] for details of the naming convention.



Next test the Python bindings. You should be able to open a terminal and type:

    python -c "import mapnik;print mapnik.__file__" # should return the path to the python bindings and no errors

If the above does not work (e.g. throws an `ImportError`) then please go back and ensure Mapnik is properly [installed](Mapnik-Installation).
