title: "Summer of Code 2012: Status update"

As I follow up to my last [post](http://mapnik.org/news/2012/06/19/gsoc2012-status/) I will give a short overview what has happened this week and what I will do next:
    
## Current status

Itemizing text with respect to format and direction works now, but itemizing on [script](http://unicode.org/reports/tr24/) is still missing. This is not trivial as certain characters don't have a fixed script value but get it from the surrounding characters.
However I found an [example](http://mapnik.org/news/2012/06/19/gsoc2012-status/) in ICUs "extra" directory and will use this as a base for my own code (or use it unmodified if that works).

## Next steps

I will add line breaking next. This is actually a rather complex task because you need to perform the following steps:
    
* Shape the text to get actual glyph widths
* Perform line breaking
* Determine characters from glyphs
* Shape again

Also I will try to build some test cases for my code to verify it is working correctly.

## Other problems to solve

* Finding font file from font name in a platform independent way
* Working with fontsets (i.e. selecting a different font if the current font doesn't have all necessary glyphs)
